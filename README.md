# Home Automation Using Facebook Chat And Arduino ESP8266 WiFi Module

In this article we are showing how you can control your home appliances e.g. TV, Fan, Refrigerator, Lights etc. from Facebook chat message with the help of Arduino Uno and ESP8266 WiFi Module. You just need to send instructions like “RED BULB ON, TV ON, Room No-1 Fan Off” in chat and it will control based on your instruction. To accomplish this project we are using Facebook Graph API to communicate with messages and created a middle ware in .NET technology which is responsible for getting the instruction from Facebook Graph API.
